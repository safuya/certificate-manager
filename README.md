# Certificate Manager

This application manages certificates, tracking expiry dates and ciphers being
used. It runs on Ruby 2.3.3 and Rails 5.2.

## Configuration

You need to add a GITHUB_ID and GITHUB_SECRET in .env in the root directory.

You will also need to run `bundle` to get the correct packages.

## Database Creation

Use rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=your_environment

Without an environment specified, development will be used. Other configured
environments are test and production.

## Test Suite

The tests use rspec and capybara. To run the tests use `rspec`. By default it
will give summarised feedback. They will give more detailed feedback if running
on a specific folder or file.

All tests are located in `spec`.
